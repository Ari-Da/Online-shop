# Online-shop (a-store)
This project was an obligatory project during my studies, where I chose to develop an online shop website called a-store. Some front end features are integrated from a PHP course at TeamTreeHouse. But the back end is entirely done manually. This website includes profile creation, with two different privileges: admin and user; the admin privilege having permissions to add, update and delete products and users. Once a user adds a product to the cart, it redirects to the paypal shopping cart; which in turn asks to log in to paypal in order to pay. But the payment should not be carried through as these are not actual products owned by us!
